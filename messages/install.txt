QuickStart (sorry for the interruption)
=====================
1) To use the package, go to a Rails view select the key where you want to add a value to and run the command "I18n Rails: Add key"

For example, select '.hello' or 'some.other.key.bye' in your view and run the plugin:

    # index.html.erb
    <%= t('.hello') %> 
    <!-- (...) -->
    <%= t('some.other.key.bye') %>


2) Also If you want to check which keys in the file are present in the `*.yml` files, you can open up a Rails view and run the command "I18n Rails: Toggle key highlighting"

Each translation is looked up in the relative or absolute path (the same logic applied for adding the values) and colored by:
  
  * missing: wasn't found on any `*.yml` file.
  * partial: was found in some locales but no all (for example, only defined in en.yml but missing in es.yml).
  * full: is correctly added.
